# Test Case

## Objectives
The purpose of testing the software is defined here in detail. Relevant and crucial information, which can make the process understandable for the reader is mainly included in this section of the format.

## Preconditions
The items and documents that were required before executing a particular test case is mentioned with proper evidence and records. Moreover, it describes the features and conditions required for testing. Other important details included here are:

- Requirement Specification.
- Detail Design Specification.
- User Guides.
- Operations Manual.
- System Design Specifications.

## Input Specifications 
Once the preconditions are defined, the team works together to identify all the inputs that are required for executing the test cases. These can vary on the basis of the level the test case is written for.

## Output Specification
These include all outputs that are required to verify the test case such as data, tables, human actions, conditions, files, timings, etc.

## Post Conditions
Here, the team defines the the various environment requirements stated by the team after the process of testing. Moreover, the team identifies the any special requirements and constraints on the test cases. It consists of details like:

## Hardware
configuration and limitations.

## Software
System, operating system, tools, etc.

## Procedural Requirements
Special setup, output location & identification, operations interventions, etc.

## Others
Mix of applications, facilities, trainings, among other things.

## Intercase Dependencies
Finally the team identifies any requirements or prerequisites test cases. Here, the test cases are documented with references other requirements and specifications. To ensure the quality of these test cases the team identifies follow on test cases
