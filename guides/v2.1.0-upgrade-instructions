#Upgrade Instructions for `v2.1.0`

Version `2.1.0` of terrad is [here](). In case proposal [11561](https://station.terra.money/proposal/columbus-5/11561) passes the chain will be halted at block height 13215800 (estimate on 14th of June around 13:00 UTC). Validators are then asked to isntall the v2.1.0 of the `terrad` binary, which contains the `v4` upgrade handler

##What is The Upgrade Handler Going to Do?

From a technical perspective this upgrade is going to remove the legacy wasm module of Terra Classic (a.k.a x/wasm) with a more common implementation amongst other Cosmos chains (a.k.a wasmd). For this to happen the chain needs a database migration of smart contract and code annotations. The code itself and the kv-stores of the contracts are not touched during this process. The upgrade handler is going to:

- set the wasmd module parameters
- migrate code annotations from x/wasm -> wasmd
- migrate smart contract annotations from x/wasm -> wasmd

Additionally we will see the handler to:

- set min. delegation commission for every validator = 5%
- set max. delegation commission for every validator = 5% (in case it was lower than 5% prior to the upgrade)
- Migration of the IBC module store
