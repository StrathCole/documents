### Testnet Upgrade Guide

The L1 team is about to release the v2.0.0 of the terrad validator client software. The upgrade contains the bump to Cosmos-SDK v.0.45.x. This is a rather big upgrade the Terra Classic network is facing here. In order to be sure that the upgrade on the **columbus-5** mainnet goes as smoothly as possible, we would request all validators to join the `rebel-2` testnet. The Terra Classic L1 team will lay out an on-chain governance upgrade plan for this network. Background info: The `rebel-2` network was originally created by Dr. Edward Kim. As it contains some on-chain state (as opposed to a newly created one that the L1 team would set up solely for the upgrade tests) it's an ideal candidate for this initiative.

#### Please, Join the Testnet

Please use the following network parameters to join the `rebel-2` network:

- [genesis.json](https://rebel-2.s3.amazonaws.com/genesis.json)
- addrbook.json

NOTE: We cannot give you an guide how to join the testnet exactly or what your local setup has to be in order to join that net. The purpose of this initiative is to test the upgrade with an validatorset and in an environment that is as close as possible to the `columbus-5` mainnet. We would prefer that the validators would join the `rebel-2` network with a setup that is similar to the one that they use for the `columbus-5`.

If validators need larger amount of testnet tokens, then they can reach out to Edward Kim or the L1 team in the Validator Discord channel. Please tag @ek826#9351 or @fragwuerdig#4755. These two persons can send testnet tokens. Smaller amounts of testnet tokens can be received from the [faucet](https://faucet.terrac.dev/).

#### Software Upgrade Proposal on the Testnet

The L1 team is going to make an software upgrade proposal. The exact date of when the upgrade proposal is going to be submitted will be announced here. We kindly ask validators to vote on this proposal when they are asked to.
