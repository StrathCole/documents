# Upgrade Instructions for `v2.2.1`

Version `2.2.1` of terrad is [here](https://github.com/classic-terra/core/releases/tag/v2.2.1). In case proposal [11561](https://station.terraclassic.community/proposal/columbus-5/11766) passes the chain will be halted at block height `14,514,000` (estimate on Sep 12, 2023, 10:38:16 UTC). Validators are then asked to install the v2.2.1 of the `terrad` binary, which contains the `v5` upgrade handler. This restarts the chain and upgrades Terra Classic to v2.2.1

## Install Instructions
