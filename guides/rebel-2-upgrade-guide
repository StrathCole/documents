### Testnet Upgrade Guide

The L1 team is about to release the v2.0.0 of the terrad validator client software. The upgrade contains the bump to Cosmos-SDK v.0.45.x. In order to be sure that the Upgrade on the **columbus-5** mainnet goes as smoothly as possible, we would request all validators to join the **maquis-1** testnet.

NOTE: The **maquis-1** testnet has still to be set up.

#### Please, Join the Testnet

The **maquis-1** testnet was set up solely for the purpose of doing the upgrade test in advance of a mainnet upgrade. Please use the following network parameters:

- genesis.json
- addrbook.json

NOTE: These still have to be generated and announced
