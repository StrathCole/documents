To summarize with this patch we seek to align with the upstream feature.js SDK related changes from TFL, add in a few quality-of-life updates to our docker tooling and patch ad-hoc security issue in our network. This upgrade need has been communicated to validators for some time now however due to their inability to act on the matter we feel its time to seek public approval from the governance layer so we can entice them to update to [v2.0.4](https://github.com/classic-terra/oracle-feeder/releases/tag/v2.0.4) .

### Consequnce of a NO vote
If the vote results in a NO, we will be leave the AS-IS oracle feeders in place until such a time that the validators decide to patch themselves.
