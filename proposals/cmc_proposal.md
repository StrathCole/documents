# Dealing with CoinMarketCap and other listings

As TFL initially listed Terra Classic on CoinMarketCap and other aggregators, CEXes and the like, they are still the only entity holding the keys to access the relevant dashboards to change links to website, social and other information for LUNC and USTC.  
Given that TFL are ordered to leave the space at the end of October 2024, there is an urgent need to gain access to these dashboards before 31 October 2024 and be able to change data by governance consensus.

## The Problem

Companies like CoinMarketCap only accept change requests through the official channels of the legal entity with which they have a legal agreement. These official channels may be the official email address or official socials.  
It is unlikely that the community will ever get access to the terra.money domain or the official @terra_money X account. Defining new official socials or nominating and voting for an official representative will also not be possible.

After the socials and website links on CMC were changed on the initiative of an individual in the community without a decision from governance, this was reversed by an opposing entity by contacting TFL. This means that CMC currently has no socials or website links for Terra Classic, including a link to GitHub, making it look like a dead project.

These circumstances create an 'emergency' scenario for our blockchain, where we could lose access to the ability to update valuable information on well-known and frequently used websites. This could cost the chain a significant amount of time and money to regain access, as litigation will be required to resolve the matter.

## The Solution

In order to give the community more time to come to an agreement, we propose that TFL be asked to transfer access to the CoinMarketCap dashboards and potential other chain information management dashboards (i.e. tools for managing links to website, social, chain information texts on third party websites) to Allnodes as a trusted entity by 30 October 2024 at the latest. TFL is also asked to contact the relevant entities and ask them to accept Allnodes as the new point of contact for Terra Classic listings.  
We also ask that any terms relating to historical costs and previously paid fees be honoured, as the requested change is simply to change the contact details of Luna Classic (Terra Classic) to the newly assigned custodian and contact point.

Allnodes has already agreed to act as a temporary custodian of these access rights and agreements, to make any relevant changes according to governance decisions, and to relinquish ownership of these listings at such time as the TerraClassic governance decides.

This proposal, if approved and accepted by TFL and the Listing Entities, would allow time for chain governance to make a decision on how to deal with listings on third party websites and portals in the future. Once governance had agreed on a new entity to hold these rights in the future, Allnodes would hand over access to the new owners. If we are successful in achieving this, it is proposed that the current governance agreed point of contact for listing information would be recorded in a public document on the classic-terra/documents repository. Future changes to this document would be made after a new custodian and contact point have been established through governance decisions.

In view of the time-critical situation, a discussion phase on the Commonwealth has been skipped and this proposal has been put to a vote straight away. We ask for your understanding that a 7+7 day governance phase would have been too long in this case.

## Guidelines & Procedures

Any changes to any of the above communication channels (relayers) should be proposed in an open discussion over a minimum period of 7 days on Commonwealth prior to voting.

This will ensure that every member of the community has the opportunity to interact and contribute to the issue in a fair and reasoned manner. This gives the community and its contributors a fair chance for input and recognition.

After a passed proposal, any changes or requests that are submitted must be accompanied by the approved proposal #(number) that was voted for and submitted by the author (proposer) in the form of a pull request for approval and merge on the classic-terra [GitHub](https://github.com/classic-terra). This request will be reviewed and merged by any of the approved users from the list according to the passed proposal #12129 (Integrated Ruleset for Secure and Inclusive Terra Classic L1 Development).

If the proposer does not know how to submit a pull request, any member of the approved user list at that time can help them with the process. The approved users from the list will check that all requested changes are consistent with the proposal before approval and merge.

The guidelines apply to:

* Decentralised exchanges
  * Blogs
  * Dashboards
  * Contact information
  * Official channels (e.g. Telegram, Discord, Instagram, Facebook, X, YouTube and official website)

* Centralised exchanges
  * Blogs
  * Dashboards
  * Contact information
  * Official channels (e.g. Telegram, Discord, Instagram, Facebook, X, YouTube and official website)

* Information relays, including but not limited to
  * CoinMarketCap
  * Coingecko
  * TradingView

Any request for a change will need to be discussed on Commonwealth with a required 7 day discussion period and after that a proposal will need to be submitted through Governance for approval.
