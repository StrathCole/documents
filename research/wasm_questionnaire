The Terra Classic L1 team wants to find out some background data in order to evaluate how to proceed with various dependency maintenance tasks on the Terra Classic chain. Therefore it hands out this questionnaire to all Smart Contract and dApp builders on Terra Classic. If you are a DAO or Team that handles multiple projects on Terra Classic, then we would like to ask you to fill out this questionnaire for each project individually. In filling out this questionnaire you are doing us and the Terra Classic community a great favor. On behalf of the Terra Classic community we would like to thank you
